# Description
This is a game where you use the buttons on the CPX board to follow a sequence played by the LEDs in 2 different colors. The sequence generated is random everytime and if the sequence played is incorrect, the game restarts. The inputs for this game are the buttons and the outputs for this game are the LEDs and also a tone being played depending on whether the sequence is right or not. There are levels that start from 1 and ends at 10. The number of LEDs that appear on the CPX board corresonds to the level you are at. The LEDs start flashing from 1 to 10 depending on the level.
